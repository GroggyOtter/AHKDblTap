I'm not a lawyer, so don't expect a ton of legal mumbo jumbo
My intent should be clear:

Any code I post or provide on any forum can be used by anyone as long as the code remains free, isn't sold in any wa,  and it isn't used to generate a profit.

Free means free. Knowledge should be free and shared.

As for crediting:

If you use this code and want to credit me with it, that's fine.
Please use /u/GroggyOtter on Reddit & GitHub.

If you do not want to credit me, that is also fine.
I do this to teach/educate/help others, not because I expect exposure.

Use your own discretion.
