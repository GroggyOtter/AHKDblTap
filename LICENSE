I'm not a lawyer, so don't expect a ton of legal mumbo jumbo
My intent should be clear:

Any code I post or provide on any forum can be used by anyone as long as the code remains free, isn't sold in any way, and isn't used to generate profit.

Free means free.

As for crediting:

If you use this code and want to credit me with writing it, that's fine.
Please use /u/GroggyOtter on Reddit & GitHub.

If you do not want to credit me, that is also fine.
I do this to teach/educate/help others, not because I expect exposure.

Use your own discretion.
